README PAGE ABOUT "A way to cultivate yourself simply about stars"


/* How to run the code */

First, to open the project, select the html folder "HOME.html". 
This is the first page of the project.
After opening the folder "HOME.html", you can enter an e-mail and a password (but they will not work),
then the button "lgin" will lead you to the principal page of the website. 


/* What's on my website */

This web page is aimed at people who are interested in astronomy in a global way.
Initially, the user is presented with a first web page, were an image is schown as well as a login part.
The next page, after clicking on the "login" button, leads to a drop-down menu which is 
available in order to navigate more easily between the different tabs of the site.   

On this menu, several tabs are presented to allow the user to focus his or her search. 

The user, depending on his nationality, can also choose to change the language of the page. 
(For the moment this option is not yet developed)

As the page is scrolled through, the user learns about the first time the telescope was invented, 
the materials used in its creation, and finally who came up with the idea of using it to observe the stars. 

When the mouse is placed on the "About Stars" choice, several other sections are available, such as: 
"Definition", "Stars, what they are in reality", "Tips" and "World Origin". These sections provide additional information about the stars. 

When the mouse is placed on the "Examples" choice, example tables on stars and different constellations are proposed. 

When the mouse is placed on the "Quizz" choice, a small quiz, for those who want to practise what they have retained 
from the information, is available. 

When the mouse is placed on the "Contact us" choice, the possibility to register is given, as well as to 
make a comment on the website. 

Finaly, a section "Canvas" is added on the website. When clicking on it, the link will lead to a page where a lot of
pictures are schown, and even a map on the constellations. 

To return to the main page, go to the bottom of the different pages and click on the link "Here to go to the main page". 



/* Why a choose this type of subject for my website */

I wanted to create this site with different information about the stars because they fascinate me. They represent distant 
objects that are part of our universe, and they exist since the beginning of the universe. I found it interesting to be able 
to gather information on this subject on the same page. 



/* How did I developed it */

I created it a little more every day. Every time I had a new idea, I wrote it down and made sure I put it on the website. 
My code was always evolving, and many changes were made in the structure itself.
